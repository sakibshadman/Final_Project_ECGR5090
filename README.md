Improving the Resolution-Precision Trade-off in Quantitative Ultrasound Estimation using Deep Neural Network
This is a project that uses a deep neural network to improve the resolution-precision trade-off in quantitative ultrasound estimation. The project is implemented in a Jupyter notebook, using Python. 

Background
Quantitative ultrasound (QUS) is a non-invasive technique used to characterize tissue properties based on the analysis of ultrasound signals. QUS parameters can be used to diagnose and monitor a variety of diseases, including osteoporosis, cancer, and liver fibrosis. However, QUS estimation can be challenging, due to the trade-off between resolution and precision. Increasing the resolution of QUS estimates typically reduces their precision, while increasing precision typically reduces resolution.
